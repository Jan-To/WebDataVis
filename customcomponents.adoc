What if we want to create two scatterplots instead of one, e.g. one for departure airports and one for arrival airports? We could duplicate the code for the SVG, like so:

[source,html,linenums]
----
<svg width="800" height="400">
  {#each datapoints as datapoint}
    <circle cx={scaleX(datapoint.from_long)}
        cy={scaleY(datapoint.from_lat)}
        r={scaleRadius(datapoint.distance)}
        class:international={datapoint.from_country != datapoint.to_country}/> (2)
  {/each}
</svg>

<svg width="800" height="400">
  {#each datapoints as datapoint}
    <circle cx={scaleX(datapoint.to_long)}
        cy={scaleY(datapoint.to_lat)}
        r={scaleRadius(datapoint.distance)}
        class:international={datapoint.from_country != datapoint.to_country}/> (2)
  {/each}
</svg>
----

It would be nicer if we could something like this instead:

[source,html,linenums]
----
<Scatterplot which="from" />
<Scatterplot which="to" />
----

This is where we really start to get into the strengths of svelte, because it is a framework to create _custom HTML components_; in this case, a `Scatterplot` component.

=== Proof of principle using the Svelte REPL
As a proof of principle, we'll create a new component by clicking the big `+` sign next to `App.svelte`. Give this component the name `MyComponent.svelte` (check the capitalisation!).

In this new component, add the following code:

[source,html,linenums]
----
<h2>Custom component</h2>
This is a custom component.
----

In the `App.svelte`, write

[source,html,linenums]
----
<script>
    import MyComponent from './MyComponent.svelte'
</script>

<h1>Svelte REPL</h1>
We can write HTML here, and see it rendered in the pane on the right.

We can also add a custom components:

<MyComponent />
<MyComponent />
----

Your output will look like this:

image:mycomponent.png[]

In the `<script>` section, we load the custom `MyComponent` element, and we use that in the HTML part of `App.svelte`. As you can see, we can call this element more than once.

=== Converting our airports map to a component
Create a new subfolder in `src` named `components`, and create a new file named `Scatterplot.svelte`. We'll move everything that is relevant to the scatterplot itself to this file:

[source,html,linenums]
----
<script>
  export let datapoints = []; <1>

  const rescale = function(x, domain_min, domain_max, range_min, range_max) {
    return ((range_max - range_min)*(x-domain_min))/(domain_max-domain_min) + range_min
  }
</script>

<style>
  circle {
    opacity: 0.5;
    fill: blue;
  }
  circle.international {
    fill: red;
  }
</style>

<svg width=800 height=400>
  {#each datapoints as datapoint}
    <circle cx={rescale(datapoint.from_long, -180, 180, 0, 800)}
            cy={rescale(datapoint.from_lat, -90, 90, 400, 0)}
            r={rescale(datapoint.distance, 1, 15406, 2,10)}
            class:international="{datapoint.from_country != datapoint.to_country}" />
  {/each}
</svg>
----
At *(1)*, this component defines a `datapoints` variable. Because of the `export let` instead of just `let` we can access this variable from outside. Now how do we do that? We have moved all scatterplot specific code from `src/routes/+page.svelte` into this new component. We rewrite `src/routes/+page.svelte` to look like this:

[source,html,linenums]
----
<script>
  import Scatterplot from './Scatterplot.svelte'; <1>
  export let data = []; <2>
</script>

<h1>Airports</h1>
<Scatterplot datapoints={data.flights}/>
----
We first import this new `Scatterplot` element that we created *(1)*. We get the data just like before from `+page.js` *(2)*. Finally, we pass `data.flights` as the value for the `datapoints` variable of the `Scatterplot` *(3)*. The `Scatterplot` element takes a `datapoints` attribute. This attribute exists because we defined the `export let datapoints` in the component.

CAUTION: Components that we create ourselves (like `Scatterplot`) must be capitalised: `scatterplot` will not work. This in contrast to the regular HTML elements (`h1`,`div`,...).

In our new `Scatterplot` component, the fact that we use the departure airports (`from_long` and `from_lat`) is hard-coded. We can change our code so that we can pass this as an argument. In the code below, we `export` two new variables (`long` and `lat`) that we default to the departure airport.

`Scatterplot.svelte`:
[source,html,linenums]
----
<script>
  export let datapoints = [];
  export let long = 'from_long'; <1>
  export let lat = 'from_lat';

  const rescale = function(x, domain_min, domain_max, range_min, range_max) {
    return ((range_max - range_min)*(x-domain_min))/(domain_max-domain_min) + range_min
  }
</script>

<style>
  circle {
    opacity: 0.5;
    fill: blue;
  }
  circle.international {
    fill: red;
  }
</style>

<svg width=1000 height=500>
  {#each datapoints as datapoint}
    <circle cx={rescale(datapoint[long], -180, 180, 0, 800)} <2>
            cy={rescale(datapoint[lat], -90, 90, 400, 0)}
            r={rescale(datapoint.distance, 1, 15406, 2,10)}
            class:international="{datapoint.from_country != datapoint.to_country}" />
  {/each}
</svg>
----

`src/routes/+page.svelte`:
[source,html,linenums]
----
<script>
  import Scatterplot from './Scatterplot.svelte';
  export let data = [];
</script>

<h1>Airports</h1>
<Scatterplot datapoints={datapoints_from_app} long="from_long" lat="from_lat" />  <3>
<Scatterplot datapoints={datapoints_from_app} long="to_long" lat="to_lat" />
----

In the `Scatterplot.svelte` component, we add the new variables *(1)*, and change the hard-coded call to `datapoint.from_long` to one where we use these variables (`datapoint[long]`) *(2)*. Finally, we use this by adding the new argument when create a scatterplot in `src/routes/+page.svelte` *(3)*.

As an exercise, you can create a more generic scatterplot component that is not specific for plotting longitudes and latitudes.

=== Passing data around
In the example above, we passed data from `src/routes/+page.svelte` to `Scatterplot.svelte`. There are different ways of making data available between components (i.e. different `+page.svelte` pages). Mainly, these are:

- to use a svelte _store_, but we won't go into this here.
- to pass them as arguments between components.

It's the second solution that we are using. Here's an overview:

image:passing_data_around.png[width=75%,pdfwidth=75%]

=== Custom visuals
We can take this further and create real custom visuals. Here, we'll use the well-known iris dataset, listing the size of sepals and petals as well as the species for 150 flowers. These flowers have quite distinct sepals and petals, as you can see in this picture:

image:iris_versicolor.jpg[width=25%,pdfwidth=25%]

[.small]#Source: www.plant-world-seeds.com#

The data is available from https://vda-lab.github.io/assets/iris.csv and looks like this:

```
sepal_length,sepal_width,petal_length,petal_width,species
5.1,3.5,1.4,0.2,setosa
4.9,3.0,1.4,0.2,setosa
4.7,3.2,1.3,0.2,setosa
4.6,3.1,1.5,0.2,setosa
5.0,3.6,1.4,0.2,setosa
5.4,3.9,1.7,0.4,setosa
4.6,3.4,1.4,0.3,setosa
5.0,3.4,1.5,0.2,setosa
4.4,2.9,1.4,0.2,setosa
...
```

It should be simple for you now to create a scatterplot showing either length and width of the sepals, or those of the petals. We'll go further here, and create a small multiple view like the one below:

image:flowers.png[width=75%,pdfwidth=75%]

A single flower looks like this:

image:flower.png[width=25%,pdfwidth=25%]

The sepals and petals are the big and small parts of the flower, respectively. We also add a circle behind it with a colour that corresponds to the species.

Let's first create the `Flower.svelte` component itself:

[source,html,linenums]
----
<script>
    // A datapoint looks like this:
    // { petalLength: 1.4,
    //   petalWidth: 0.2,
    //   sepalLength: 5.1,
    //   sepalWidth: 3.5,
    //   species: "setosa" }

    export let datapoint = {};

    let scale = 3; <1>
    $: sl = scale * datapoint.sepalLength;
    $: sw = scale * datapoint.sepalWidth;
    $: pl = scale * datapoint.petalLength;
    $: pw = scale * datapoint.petalWidth;
    $: sepal_path =
        "M 0,0 " + "C " + sl + ",-" + sw + " " + sl + "," + sw + " 0,0 Z"; <2>
    $: petal_path =
        "M 0,0 " + "C " + pl + ",-" + pw + " " + pl + "," + pw + " 0,0 Z";
</script>

<g> <3>
    <circle cx="0" cy="0" r="10" class={datapoint.species} /> <4>
    <path style="transform: rotate(270deg)" d={sepal_path} /> <5>
    <path style="transform: rotate(30deg)" d={sepal_path} />
    <path style="transform: rotate(150deg)" d={sepal_path} />
    <path style="transform: rotate(325deg)" d={petal_path} />
    <path style="transform: rotate(90deg)" d={petal_path} />
    <path style="transform: rotate(210deg)" d={petal_path} />
</g>

<style>
    circle.setosa {
        fill: #7570b3;
        fill-opacity: 0.3;
    }
    circle.virginica {
        fill: #1b9e77;
        fill-opacity: 0.3;
    }
    circle.versicolor {
        fill: #d95f02;
        fill-opacity: 0.3;
    }
</style>

----

The following things are noteworthy:

* *(1)* The scale we define here is just a hack-y way for getting images that I find good in size. As an exercise, replace this hard-coded scale with a slider.
* *(2)* Here we define the `path` to draw a single petal or sepal. See <<curves>> for how these are defined.
* *(3)* Because none of these petals or sepals stand on their own but are part of a single glyph, it is good practive to group them in a `<g>` element.
* *(4)* The circle that is at the back of each flower and is coloured according to species.
* *(5)* Each of the parts of the flower is drawn in the same way (see *(2)*): we start the path on position `(0,0)` and draw to the right. For each of the parts we then rotate it. You can check the effect by removing the style attribute.

In our `src/routes/+page.svelte` we will load this data.

[source,html,linenums]
----
<script>
    import Flower from './Flower.svelte'
    
    export let data = [];

    const get_xy = function(idx) { <1>
        let y = 25 + (Math.floor(idx / 20) * 50)
        let x = 25 + ((idx % 20) * 50)
        return [x,y]
    }
    $: console.log(data.flowers) <2>

</script>

<svg width=1000 height=1000>
    {#each data.flowers as datapoint,idx} <3>
        <g transform="translate({get_xy(idx)[0]}, {get_xy(idx)[1]})"> <4>
            <Flower datapoint={datapoint} />
        </g>
    {/each}
</svg>
----

At *(1)* we create a function that returns an x and y offset for a given index (see *(3)*). There are better ways of doing this (e.g. using https://getbootstrap.com/[Bootstrap]), but we just code our own here, creating rows of 20 flowers. *(2)* shows how we can use `console.log` to make sure that the datapoints we load are actually what we expected. This is a typical way in svelte to check what's going on: because we start the command with a `$:`, this will run every time the value for `datapoints` changes. In *(3)* we loop over all datapoints, but we return both the single datapoint _and_ its index (which we call `idx`). This index is what will be used by `get_xy` to calculate the position on the screen. Finally, we transform the flower that is drawn in *(4)* to put it in the correct position.
