== Environment setup
In this part of the course, we will focus on the programming aspect. We will use standard web technologies for this: HTML, CSS and javascript.

We will use https://stackblitz.com[stackblitz], an "instant fullstack web IDE for the javascript ecosystem" (source: Stackblitz developer site). Nevertheless, we also mention below how to set up the necessary stack on your own computer.

=== Stackblitz

There are many different types of projects that stackblitz has templates for. For data visualisation, you might use a vanilla HTML/CSS/javascript setup, or (as in this course) Sveltekit.

=== Local installation
If you want to set up a development environment on your own machine, you will need node and Visual Studio Code.

==== Node
We'll need to install node, a javascript runtime. You can get it http://nodejs.org[here].

==== Visual Studio Code
We'll use Visual Studio Code ("vscode" for short) as a code editor. You can get it https://code.visualstudio.com[here].

You will also want to add some _extensions_ to make programming for visualisation a bit easier. You can do this by clicking on the "Extensions" icon in the left bar:

The extensions that we recommend, are:

- Svelte for VS Code (by Svelte)
- Svelte Intellisense (by ardenivanov)

=== Exercises
We have set up a group of exercises that will guide you through the different facets of creating visualisations using web technologies and sveltekit. You will find these at the bottom of each page.

*Svelte* is a language and compiler for building web applications. It allows you to create reusable components. *SvelteKit* is a full-stack web application framework built _on top of_ Svelte.

==== Github
To be able to log into stackblitz, you'll have to create an account on https://github.com/[github] first. This will make it easier to get everything organised.

// We have prepared a project on github so that the right structures are set up and the necessary boilerplate code is ready to go. To get set up:

// ===== On github
// - Log into github
// - Go to http://github.com/vda-lab/datavis-technologies-handson
// - Click on "Fork"

// ===== On stackblitz
// - Log in using your github account
// - Go to https://stackblitz.com/codeflow[https://stackblitz.com/codeflow] and click on "Join the Codeflow Beta"
// - Click on "repositories" in the left and then on the "datavis-technologies-handson"
